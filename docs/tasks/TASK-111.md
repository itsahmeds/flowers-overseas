# TASK-111 — Country occasion `/{locale}/{country-shop}/{occasion}`: the dated line for that country via `nextOccasions` + `formatDate`, toolbar/grid/pagination, breadcrumb, `rule_type: none` rendered undated, Romania's Orthodox Easter honest-blank until spec 009 task 2 (PR #67 Q6)

Row: `TASKS.md` → TASK-111. This brief is the task's long form: the row keeps a link and one
sentence, everything else lives here (spec 001 §14 A15, AC-34). Scaffold it with
`pnpm tasks:brief TASK-111`; keep it current by editing this file, not the row.

## Binding

- **Scope.** Country occasion `/{locale}/{country-shop}/{occasion}` — no AC of its own; explicit scope is §12 task 7 (the country half of AC-11, whose hub half is TASK-112) and the country-occasion rows of T-01 and T-11. The dated line for that country comes from `nextOccasions` through the view model, never computed in the component. **You also land the occasion table's third column** on the shop root — which of the listed occasions is a link — now that country-occasion pages exist (spec 008 §14 **A10**), with the artboard parity check that goes with it.

- **Route shape (spec 008 §14 A5, binding).** Your page type is served from the **shared per-depth route files** TASK-109 introduced — `src/app/[locale]/[segment]/page.tsx` (depth 2) and `src/app/[locale]/[segment]/[child]/page.tsx` (depth 3), or the depth-4 files for country category/occasion. Add your branch to `resolveLocalePath()` in `src/modules/catalog/routes.ts` and its module page component. **Create no new route file** at a depth that already has one; Next allows one dynamic slug name per depth and that is what A5 exists to prevent.
- **Rulings that bind:** spec 008 §14 **A1** (evergreen hub existence), **A2** (provenance note once per card), **A3** (`items` xor `hubItems`; a hub shows no money), **A4** (`listingView()` is async), **A6** (`occasionDates` on the shop root), **A7** (trailing slash is a 308 everywhere, asserted in T-01), **A8** (message keys, empty-state proof, toolbar/pagination wait for TASK-114, the desktop artboard is one grid), **A9** (spec text governs over a stale artboard — if a drawing shows a block the normative list omits, leave it out and add a dated row to `docs/design/README.md`), **A10** (the occasion table's third column lands with TASK-111). Spec 007 §14 **A5–A8**.
- **One source.** `listingView()` from `src/modules/catalog` feeds the page, its JSON-LD and its sitemap row. Build no second view model and no second card; compose TASK-108's `src/modules/ui/shop/` primitives. `app/` stays thin. Metadata only through `buildMetadata()` / `pageIndexability()` — no robots literal in a route.
- **Copy and honesty.** No literal user-facing strings; add only the keys your states need, `pl` plurals hand-authored, `pnpm i18n:check` clean, and keep the `en` unreviewed share under the 5 % gate (report it). No delivery, ranking or same-day promise (spec 008 AC-9); add your page type to `PAGES` in `tests/e2e/chrome-honesty.spec.ts`.
- **Gates:** unit; e2e T-01 over four locales including the 404 shapes and the trailing-slash 308; the empty state; axe; `darwin` visual baselines for your artboards; `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm i18n:check`, `pnpm check:no-db`, `pnpm codebase:map --check`; report the script-budget delta (it should be +0.0 KB — these pages ship no island until TASK-114) and Lighthouse if your page type joins the measured set.

- PR title `feat(shop): country occasion page and the shop-root occasion links (TASK-111)`.
