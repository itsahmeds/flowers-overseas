# TASK-371 — Spec 022a the review form: `/{locale}/review/{token}` (a `GET` that writes nothing, the emailed star preselected), `submitReview` with `ReviewSubmission` and `review.created`, one page for expired and unknown links, the opt-out `POST`, `Disallow: /*/review/`, `StarRadioGroup`

Row: `TASKS.md` → TASK-371. This brief is the task's long form: the row keeps a link and one
sentence, everything else lives here (spec 001 §14 A15, AC-34). Scaffold it with
`pnpm tasks:brief TASK-371`; keep it current by editing this file, not the row.

## Binding

Planned 2026-10-22 by `/plan-tasks` (b) (work order `wo-1022-common.md`). Size M. Merges after: TASK-370, PR 338 (design).
- Spec 022a §2 (form), §5.2 (`ReviewSubmission`), §5.3 (form states), §5.4, §6, §12 order (4). Owns AC-12 to AC-15. One review per order; status unchanged by `review.created` (status-preserving, actor `buyer`).
- `reviews.*` is a new public namespace: report its `en` text for the founder's batch; never `reviewed: true`.
- **Built from the merged artboards** of PR 338 (`review-form-*`); match them pixel for pixel. If the board you need is missing, stop and escalate; never build a page from the description alone.
- **Class:** self-review (no checker agents; founder 2026-10-22). You are the reviewer and the breaker: put `## Self-review` in the PR (every AC with file:line and its test; the mutation and red run for each AC assertion; the awkward cases below with each result; carry-forwards) before `gh pr ready`.
- **Awkward cases you run yourself:** a mail scanner's `GET` (row counts unchanged); a replayed `POST`; a `POST` after `expires_at`; an unknown token (same page as expired); 1001 graphemes with emoji and `ż`; ratings 0 and 6; keyboard-only submit; the opt-out `GET` (no write).
- **Founder rulings bind every buyer line** (specs 013, 016, 018 §14): every payment is captured at placement; no buyer surface, email, PDF or copy key says or implies partners, a florist accepting, offers, re-routing or a held card (`RELAY_PATTERNS`, `RELAY_EXEMPT`, `relayMatches` in `src/config/honesty.ts`: use them, keep no list of your own); no refund or failure wording after payment except the cancellation and refund messages; no em dash in any copy.
- Order status only through spec 010's `orderService.transition` / `appendEvent` (ADR-0009); money as integer minor units with a currency; Zod at every boundary; no PII, token or address in logs, URLs, Sentry or analytics.
- Copy: never `reviewed: true` (the founder's act). Keys under `checkout`, `orderConfirmation`, `orderTracking`, `florist`, `admin`, `demo`, `dev`, `email` may be added `reviewed: false`; any other new key text is reported in the PR for the founder's batch (spec 003 §14 A17).
- Integration tests run on a throwaway local PG16 (`@embedded-postgres/darwin-arm64`, your own scratch subfolder, stopped by PID); never `.env.local`'s `DATABASE_URL*`. Vitest with `--maxWorkers=2`, only the files your diff touches; read `uptime` first.

## Carry-forwards

One dated bullet per `/review`, newest last.

_None yet._

## Escalations

One dated bullet per escalation: the question, who it went to, the answer or `open`.

_None recorded._

## Progress

One line per coherent step, newest last, written by the agent doing the work and pushed with
the commit: what is done, what is next, anything a replacement agent must know. A finisher starts
here.

_Not started._

## Result

What shipped, in one paragraph: the PR, the tests added per layer, the numbers a reviewer needs
(budgets, counts), and anything handed to a later task.

_Pending._
